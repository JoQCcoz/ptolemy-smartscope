# Ptolemy
This repository contains source code for Ptolemy, a Python machine learning and computer vision library for automating cyro-EM data collection. The accompanying paper is available on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01534).

## Functionality
Basic functionality is currently in place. Images are handled by the `Exposure` class in `ptolemy/images.py`, with algorithms for processing low and medium mag images in `ptolemy/algorithms`. 

Model weights and tutorial coming soon.
